# personal-productivity

## What I want from this web app
* Productivity data for
    * Day
    * Week
    * Month
    * Year
* Time yourself (pomodoro style)
    * sesssion concept
        * set focus time and break time
        * then how much of these sessions you want to do
    * example: set 'focused session' for 50 minutes, then a break for 10 minutes after. 
        * can duplicate if you want to do more than one of these sessions
* Goal setting (weekly/daily)
    * Set how much study hour you want to do that day
        * Checks itself when goal is met

## Features for later
